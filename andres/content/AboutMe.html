			<h1>A FEW THINGS ABOUT ME</h1>
			<p>
				My name is Kimver Joe A. Andres. I was born on September 29, 1995 
				in Baguio City, I am 23 years of age. My parents are Jonathan Andres and Jennefer Alban. I have a younger brother he is Karl Jones A. Andres. I am from Baguio City Philippines. I am currently
				taking up Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) in Saint Louis University (SLU) baguio. When i was in Elementary i
				experienced joining certain events like Math Quiz bee, Science Quiz Bee and i joined the glee club because i like singing.
				When i was a child i experienced going to other places just to compete with other schools because of the Quiz bees i attended and because of the club i joined. We were the champions here in baguio that is why we represented baguio city in manila where we did not win but we just got the most creative award. Its no lost that we did not win in manila but to experience a scenerio of competing with other schools is a moment in my life that i would cherish in the following years to come. I continue learning in my experiences in life and i continue to understand how life works.
